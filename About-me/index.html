<p>I loved study and research from the very beginning. And as I grew up, I found myself gifted in math and physics. I enjoyed talking physics with others, and even just teaching physics knowledge to my little brother was fun to me.</p>
<p>When I entered the college, a whole new world was open for me. I found my broad interest in programs with diversity. On the one hand, I started doing volunteer works and saw my leadership in taking the most work in the team and caring about everyone else, as well as giving out public presentations and performing singing/dancing on the stage. These helped me to become an outgoing and helpful man.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the beauty of unknown was still the most appealing to me. I also self-studied with math and physics books (or on-line courses) on Modern Geometry, GR, QFT, Supersymmetry and String Theory in advance. In addition, I took elective courses in our innovation department to study deep learning and data structure, too. If given more time, I would love to dedicate myself to Interdisciplinary application in physics. But I was also aware that people's life is short, we need to focus on one or two fields, and to be expert in which so that we can truly make contribution to that particular one we love and have most passion for.</p>
<p>When it comes to course study, GPA is a topic inevitable. I am glad that I could make a progress every year, which is a product of my system of physics knowledge that accumulated in everyday study, and finally got to the top in junior academic year (major ranking <u>1/41</u>, major courses average score <u>92.21/100</u> &amp; last two years GPA <u>3.89/4.00</u>). Since junior courses are considered the basis of advance knowledge, these grades also prove my potential in future graduate-level study and research.</p>
<p>Besides, as for my research programs, I feel lucky enough to carry out different research tasks in several fields like basic physics, high energy theoretical physics, and astrophysics. (The detailed works and results of my research are shown in <a href="research">another page</a>) I am very grateful that these projects are not only beneficial to me in enhancing my diverse research skills, but also help me understand clearly which field I truly want to work on the future.</p>
<p>Apart from studying and researching, I also loved to spend my time cycling, swimming, running, when I tried to take a rest. Because I think these type of activities can nurture my stamina and spirit. What's more, I lead a hiking team in my school to explore our city and nearby mountains when I was a freshmen.</p>

<p>The picture above came from Prof. Tsutomu Yanagida's presentation in <em>The 1st TDLI Summer School in Particle Physics</em> which I attended last summer. It often gave me strength and encouraged me to not be afraid of making mistakes, since discovering something new is not a linear path. The process of research is about asking yourself "why so" again and again, and still have faith that: some questions, actually, do have answers.</p>
